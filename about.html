                    <p id="about-p">I was born and raised in Reno,
                       NV. There isn't much out here, but it's growing still.
                        My goal in life is to become a programmer,
                        right now I am currently focusing on learning 

                        <a href="#" target="_blank" id="html-link">HTML</a>
                        & 
                        <a href="#" target="_blank" id="css-link">CSS.</a>
                         
                        For starters, it can help me branch out towards other coding languages.
                         I also have a girlfriend,
                          we've been dating for 2 years now
                          <a id="about-p-date">(01-06-2020)</a>,
                       and she is the love of my life, no one else could replace her ‚ô•. 
                       So, in terms of college; TMCC. It's a good community college,
                        and I'm looking at getting an Associates Degree,
                         or even higher! I'm not sure what I want to be in yet,
                          right now its Psychology because I'm also very interested with how the human brain works.
                           Psychiatry is a carreer I wanna have,
                            a long with coding. Anyways,
                             I don't know what else to say üòÇ.
                              Thank you for reading and visiting my website ‚ù§üòé!!

                      <p id="story-p">To start this story off,
                       if you didn't know, my name is Brendan Hodges. Before reading this I'd suggest reading the first about I created,
                        but it's up to you, I'm not typing all of it again ü§∑ I was born in Reno, NV; "The Biggest Littlest City in America".
                         At least it was back then, throughout my years living hear I've seen a 50% increase from 2020 - 2022. 
                          But to me, it is still home. I couldn't imagine living anywhere else,
                           I've visiting California and the people are way different than here. I'm proud to be a "Nevadian".
                            Since 2020, there has been a lot of renovations with the infastructure here since there is a lot of people moving here.
                             It's been frustrating to deal with at times,
                              because the hgihways and roads just can't fit enough people and it brings the invitation to diaster.
                                It's getting better though, in Lemmon Valley they completely renovated the highway exits thankfully.
                                 Instead of the "littlest" it is now turning into the "biggest". Apart from where I live,
                                  it introduced me to the best opportunities, and lessons in my life. And it is also only the beginning.            
                        </p>

                      <h2 id="childhood-h2">Childhood</h2>                
                      <p id="childhood-p">
                        Childhood is everyone's start toward becoming a person. On the contrary,
                         it's importance towards longer life expectancies and social-emotional capabilities.
                          I've realized growing up that getting the chance to learn through experience
                           and deep relationships makes people more robust.
                           My entire life growing up, I would compare people to me,
                            I would watch what everyone else would do in class because I had no idea.
                             That is how I learn     
                            but thinking about it from an outsiders perspective,
                             it wouldn't be good mentally long term.
                              I need to be able to let my conscious do the work.
                             I am getting better with it though,
                              after questioning it for so long I've finally found the answer.
                              Knowing it helps me to be able to think about ways to defend myself from that.
                               I don't consider my childhood bad either,
                               I have family that helped me,
                                and I always thought life was about the experience and what

                                 wanna do with it.

                             I wanna do as much as I can in life so I don't look back and regret it.
                           I think it's a good life goal.
